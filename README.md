# üõí NFT Marketplace Backend

## Overview

This is the backend system for a decentralized NFT Marketplace, designed to handle minting, trading, and managing NFTs. The system is built with a microservices architecture, utilizing technologies like **NestJS**, **Kafka**, **MongoDB**, **Elasticsearch**, and containerized with **Docker**. It provides robust APIs for managing users, assets, and marketplace transactions, ensuring high availability and scalability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Minting and Trading NFTs**: Create, buy, and sell NFTs on the marketplace.
- **User Management**: Secure user authentication and profile management.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Event-driven architecture with Kafka for real-time notifications.
- **Search and Indexing**: Full-text search capability using Elasticsearch for fast NFT and user searches.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Built with a scalable, maintainable microservices architecture.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```


### üèóÔ∏è Microservices Architecture

This project is structured as microservices, with different services responsible for handling user management, NFT minting, trading, and more. Kafka is used to facilitate communication between these services.

Here are the key microservices:

	‚Ä¢	User Service: Handles user authentication and management.
	‚Ä¢	NFT Service: Manages the creation and trading of NFTs.
	‚Ä¢	Notification Service: Sends real-time notifications using Kafka.

### üöÄ API Documentation

API documentation is auto-generated with Swagger. You can view the available endpoints by visiting http://localhost:3000/api/docs once the server is running.

üê≥ Docker & Docker Compose

The project uses Docker to containerize services for consistency across environments.

Build & Run with Docker Compose

To build and run all the services using Docker Compose, use:

docker-compose up --build
docker-compose build nft-service
docker-compose up nft-service
